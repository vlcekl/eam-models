# Thougts on fundamental principles of model optimization

## Capturing rare events in atomistic models

* Proper description of rare states, such as transition states, which are
  critical for description of defect diffusion or chemical reactions, presumes
  that the model is flexible enough to capture independently both bulk and the
  rare state. We should be able to test and improve this flexibility.
* Apply imbalance learning solutions (He et. al, 2009).
